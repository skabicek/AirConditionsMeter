# AirConditionsMeter
The project is an example of Air Conditions meter. The system consist of four components:
OLED Display - provides simple UI for user to communicate with the device, Rotary encoder
serves as controller between the user and device, and Temperature & Humidity Sensors measure
and provide accurate data on the ambient temperature and humidity levels in a given environment and the ESP32 MCU ties everything together and allows us to send the measured data
wireless via its built-in Bluetooth module. The code was prepared on Arduino IDE.
